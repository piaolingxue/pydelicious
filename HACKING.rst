This file is meant for developpers wishing to hack on this project. If thats
you, welcome :)

First of all, there is no development plan, and mostly its pretty straighforward
python hacking. If you want something from the del.icio.us service that is not
here yet, just hack and introduce yourself/your ideas at the `project homepage`_.

Here are a few comments:

- Use 4 spaces for indent. Not 2, not 8, no tabs, 4 spaces.
- Test your code. Unittests are located in tests/
- `Report bugs <http://code.google.com/p/pydelicious/issues/>`_ (please!)

What's there to do
------------------
Read the TODO/FIXME/XXX's throughout the code comments or examine the issue
list at the `project homepage`_.
